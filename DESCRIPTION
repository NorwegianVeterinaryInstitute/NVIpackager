Description: Provides tools to facilitate development of NVIverse packages. You 
    should use 'create_NVIpkg_skeleton' to make a package skeleton in accord with 
    NVIverse standards. For further development and maintenance there are 
    tools for updating documentation and installing development versions. The 
    NVIpackager functions are to a large extent wrappers for devtools and usethis
    functions. In addition, the templates folder keeps templates for standard 
    files like sections of README and CONTRIBUTING.
